## What is SQL?

SQL, which is an acronym for Structured Query Language, is a language widely used to interact with most relational databases. You can create, query, update, and delete databases using SQL. This tutorial focuses on querying databases.

If you have experience with `dplyr` in R or `Pandas` in Python, you'll find that SQL is similar in many ways.

“Database” is not a synonym of “dataset.” Databases are collections of data typically controlled by database management systems (such as MySQL or SQLite). Databases are common for large quantities of data, often consisting of multiple tables of data, that multiple users need to access efficiently and securely at the same time.

It’s important to note that, while SQL is one language, there are multiple dialects. There are [standards for SQL](https://blog.ansi.org/sql-standard-iso-iec-9075-2023-ansi-x3-135/#gref), but different vendors of database management systems provide various [versions of SQL syntax](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/sql-server-postgresql-mysql-whats-the-difference-where-do-i-start), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. However, most of the syntax, particularly basic syntax, is very similar across dialects.

## Database for this tutorial

We're working with the `hospital` database from [sql-practice.com](https://www.sql-practice.com/). You can find the schema (the set of tables, their columns and types, and the relationships between them) in the left side bar > SQL Database > View Schema.

## Comments in SQL

This is how you can comment your code in SQL:

```sql
/* this is a comment; it can 
span multiple lines */

SELECT * FROM patients; /* this is also a comment */

-- this is a single line comment

SELECT * from patients; -- another single line comment
```

### Exercise 1

Take a look at the schema of the database. Think about a query that you would like to be able to make at the end of this tutorial. Write down that query and the steps that you think you would need to take using a comment.

## `SELECT`

Select is the command we use most often in SQL.  It lets us select data (specified rows and columns) from one or more tables.  Columns are selected by name, rows are selected with conditional statements (values of a particular column meeting some criteria). 
The basic format of a `SELECT` command is this:

```sql
SELECT <columns>
FROM <table>;
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT patient_id, first_name, last_name
FROM patients;
```

If we want all of the columns, we can use `*` as shorthand:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients;
```

A couple of notes:

- SQL is case-insensitive, but many times you'll see the key terms in all caps. This is good practice for readability.
- Note that you use a semicolon `;` to end the statement. This is the standard way to separate SQL statements in systems that allow for more that one statement to be executed in the same call. (With [sql-practice.com](https://www.sql-practice.com/) we don't have to worry about that.)

### Exercise 2

Select the first\_name and last\_name columns from the patients table.

## `LIMIT`

Instead of getting all rows, we can specify a limit of the number of rows to retrieve.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
LIMIT 5;
```

The order of the rows is not random, but it is not guaranteed to be in any particular order by default either. Be careful about this when "looking at the data."

### Exercise 3

Select 10 rows from the patients table selecting the gender and birth\_date columns.

## `OFFSET`

We can  skip rows that would normally be at the beginning of the result set with offset.  This is useful usually when we sort the result set in a particular order, something we'll get to later. 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
LIMIT 5
OFFSET 2;
```

### Exercise 4

Select 10 rows from the patients table selecting the gender and birth\_date columns, but skipping the first 5 rows.

## `WHERE`

Instead of getting all rows or a specific number of rows, we can also specify which rows we want by specifying conditions on the values of particular columns (e.g., equals, greater than, less than).

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE gender = 'M';
```

Note that string (text) values in SQL are surrounded with single quotes. This may vary across databases, but typically it's safer to [use single quotes for strings in SQL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1992314/what-is-the-difference-between-single-and-double-quotes-in-sql).

You can combine conditions together with `AND` and `OR`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE gender = 'M' AND province_id = 'ON';
```

`WHERE` operators include:

| Operator | Description |
|:---:|:---|
| = | Equal |
| > | Greater than |
| < | Less than |
| >= | Greater than or equal |
| <= | Less than or equal |
| <> or != | Not equal |
| AND | Logical operator AND |
| OR | Logical operator OR |
| NOT | To negate boolean values |

### Exercise 5

a) Select rows from the patients table where the city is Toronto.

b) Select rows from the patients table where the city is Toronto and the province\_id is not ON.

c) Select rows from the patients table where the first\_name starts with a D. (Hint [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp).)

## `BETWEEN`

`BETWEEN` is shorthand for `# <= x <= #`.  The endpoints are inclusive:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE birth_date BETWEEN '1963-01-01' AND '2000-01-01';
```

### Exercise 6

Select all the columns from the patients database where the height is between 160 and 180.

## `IN`

`IN` lets you specify a lot of values that you would otherwise join together with an `OR` statement:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE city IN ('Barrie', 'Dundas', 'Hamilton');
```

### Exercise 7

Select rows from the patients table where the first name is John, Jack, or Sam using `IN`.

## `IS NULL`

As hinted earlier, missing data in SQL is `NULL`.  `NULL` values occur where there are no data entered for a specific row and column.  You can test for `NULL` with `IS NULL`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE patient_id IS NULL;
```

Note that `NULL` is different than an empty string.

There is also the opposite: `IS NOT NULL`.

You cannot use `= NULL`.  The following returns no rows, even though there are rows with `NULL` allergies:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE allergies = NULL;
```

Keep in mind that `NULL` values are omitted from the results of comparison tests. 

### Exercise 8

Select all the columns for the patients table where the birth\_date is null.

## `ORDER BY`

We can determine the order that our results are shown in:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
ORDER BY height;
```

By default, sorting is done in ascending (`ASC`) order.  To get the reverse order of sorting, use `DESC` (descending):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
ORDER BY height DESC;
```

This is often useful to combine with `LIMIT`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
ORDER BY height DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

And with `OFFSET` to view results in smaller chunks:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
ORDER BY height DESC
LIMIT 5
OFFSET 5;
```

You can order by multiple columns:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
ORDER BY height DESC, weight DESC;
```

### Exercise 9

Order the rows in patients by province\_id and then by city.

## `DISTINCT`

`DISTINCT` removes duplicate rows from the result.  It comes before the list of column names, and applies to the combination of all columns.

Notice the difference between this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT first_name
FROM patients
ORDER BY first_name;
```

And this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name
FROM patients
ORDER BY first_name;
```

### Exercise 10

Using the admissions table, find the distinct dates where patients have been admitted.

## Functions and Arithmetic

There are many common, built-in functions. You can find them in the documentation of whichever version of SQL you are using.

For example, we can get the minimum or maximum of a column from results:

```sql
SELECT MIN(height)
FROM patients;
SELECT MAX(height)
FROM patients;
```

These functions apply to the result set, not the full table: 

```sql
SELECT MAX(height)
FROM patients
WHERE height < 200;
```

You can also do arithmetic:

```sql
SELECT height, height + 1
FROM patients;
```

Functions need to be used in the part of the query where you specify the values (or other values) that you are selecting, not the `WHERE` clause.  The following doesn't work:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE height = MAX(height);
```

To achieve this, you can use a subquery (which is covered in the intermediate SQL tutorial).

If we wanted to count the number of distinct values in a column, we can use the count function in combination with `distinct`:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT first_name)
FROM patients;
```

Count without distinct will count the number of rows *that aren't null*.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(allergies)
FROM patients;
```

Keep in mind that `NULL` is not counted by `count`, even though it is returned as a result by `DISTINCT`.

We can use `*` to count the total number of rows, including any with NULL in a column:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM patients;
```

### Exercise 11

a) What are the allergies present in the patients table?
b) How many people in the patients table have an allergy to penicillin?

## `GROUP BY`

`GROUP BY` is used to divide results into groups, where you then apply some summary function to each group.  You will generally select the column you're grouping by, and then a summary function.  The most common operation is counting.  We use `COUNT(*)` to count the number of rows in each group:

```sql
SELECT first_name, COUNT(*)
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

However, we can use other functions as well.

You can group by multiple columns:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*)
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name, last_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

### Exercise 12

Count the number of cities for each province\_id in the patients table.  Order the results by `COUNT(city)`.

## `HAVING`

`HAVING` is similar to a `WHERE` clause but it applies to the result of a `GROUP BY` operation; `WHERE` applies before data are grouped by `GROUP BY`.

```sql
SELECT first_name, COUNT(*)
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(*) < 40
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

### Exercise 13

Select the province\_id from the patients table that have more than 20 cities associated with them.

## Aliasing

You can rename columns and tables in queries.  This will mostly be useful when you're joining tables together, but it can also be useful when you're working with functions. Or simply for convenience in looking at the output.

```sql
SELECT first_name, COUNT(*) AS patient_count
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name
ORDER BY patient_count DESC;
```

### Exercise 14

Using the patients table, find the number of patients by gender. Give the resulting column a descriptive title.

## `CASE WHEN`

`CASE WHEN` is a conditional statement that can be used to create new columns based on the values of other columns.  It's similar to an `if` statement in other programming languages.

```sql
SELECT
	height,
    CASE
    	WHEN height < 160 THEN 'Small'
        WHEN height BETWEEN 160 AND 180 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Tall'
    END AS height_category
FROM patients;
```

### Exercise 15

Select all columns from the table admissions. Add a column called admission\_year that takes the value of either 2018 or 2019 depending on the value of the column admission\_date.

## Recap and resources to continue learning

This tutorial provided an introduction to SQL. While this is a good starting place, there are more things to learn! The [GitHub repository that hosts this introductory tutorial](https://github.com/nuitrcs/SQL_workshops) also includes an intermediate tutorial.

This tutorial draws from a longer [introduction to databases workshop](https://github.com/nuitrcs/databases_workshop) taught by [Research Computing and Data Services at Northwestern University](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/departments/it-services-support/research/), as well as by this [resource guide](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resource-guides/resource-guide-sql/). You can check them out to continue learning! 🧠💪

One key aspect that this tutorial didn't cover is how to connect to a database. We used [sql-practice.com](https://www.sql-practice.com/), which makes it very easy to run SQL in a web browser for an introductory tutorial. But in research, you'll probably be connecting to a database from a programming language like R or Python. Here you can see [how to connect to a database using the `DBI` package in R](https://github.com/nuitrcs/databases_workshop/blob/master/r/r_databases.Rmd) and [how to connect to a database using the `psycopg2` package in Python](https://github.com/nuitrcs/databases_workshop/blob/master/python/postgresql_from_python.ipynb). If you are affiliated with Northwestern University and you run into a problem during your research, you can always [submit a consult request](https://services.northwestern.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=93).
